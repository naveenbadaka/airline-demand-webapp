# airline-demand-webapp
I built a Python Flask web app that integrates with the AviationStack API to analyze airline booking demand. The app fetches flight data, identifies top routes, and visualizes them using Chart.js. It features a simple UI, dynamic insights, and clean backend logic. The code is modular, well-documented, and ready to extend for real-world use.
